## Introduction
The project is component based. Typical setting _types_ (e.g. option list, slider, check button, etc) are all basic components that can be easily instanced and expanded to fit your needs.<br/>

Please note that GGS is designed so that it can be expanded easily, which means you might need to dive into the code and modify it to suit your own needs.<br/>
Basic game settings such as changing the resolution, volume, keybinds, etc are already built but any thing more than that should be made by yourself, which can be done easily using the basic components of the project. The code is easy to understand. However, if at any point you found yourself wondering what the heck is going on, you can check out the [github wiki page](https://github.com/PunchablePlushie/godot_ggs/wiki).
## Theme
GGS does not come with its own theme. You can check the [GUI Skinning page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/gui/gui_skinning.html) of the Godot documentation to get started with making and using your own theme.
## Quick Start
Check out the [quick start page](https://github.com/PunchablePlushie/godot_ggs/wiki/Getting-Started) on the wiki to see how you can make a basic settings menu quickly, with the premade setting nodes.
## Demo
A demo of how one can use and expand the project is available as a github repo. It has a custom theme and shows a simple example of how you can expand the project by using the base components provided. **[Get the Demo](https://github.com/PunchablePlushie/godot_ggs_demo)**!<br/>
