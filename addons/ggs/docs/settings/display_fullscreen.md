Toggles fullscreen state.

## Properties
* default/current - *bool*
* size_setting - *String* : Name of the setting responsible for resizing the window. The setting must be in the same category as this setting. If set to `[NONE]`, the window size will not be updated when the fullscreen turns off. This is particularly important when the user changes the window size *while* the game is in fullscreen.
