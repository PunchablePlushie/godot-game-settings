A group of buttons. Only one button can be selected at any time.

* Handles: *Int*, *Boolean*

## Adding Buttons/Options
You can add `Button`s to the **BtnList**. Note that all buttons must have `toggle_mode` enabled. The index of the button in **BtnList** is the index of the option (e.g. the first button returns `0`, second one returns `1`, and so on).

## Handling Booleans
You can handle boolean values if you add two buttons only. The first one is `false` and the second one is `true`.
